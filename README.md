## What does it do?

Automatically applies a dark theme in Joomla 4's administrator backend and public frontend.

## Download

I primarily wrote this for my own, personal use. I do publish occasional pre-built Joomla installation packages and make them available through [my GitHub repository's Releases page](https://github.com/nikosdion/darkmagic/releases).

## Caveats

Dark Mode themes are only applied when you are using the Atum template in the backend or Cassiopeia in the frontend. It does not apply to child templates or templates forked from Atum and Cassiopeia. If you have customized the template you may need to override the Dark Mode CSS files provided by this plugin to take into account your modifications.

This plugin does not make Dark Mode possible, it only makes it easier. You can always recompile Joomla's CSS to support dark mode or have a permanently dark mode template. After all, that's what I do here. This plugin is easier in the sense that you don't have to do media overrides. Moreover, if you change your mind you can disable the plugin instead of undoing media overrides.

Dark Mode has a lower contrast than the normal, light mode. If you're using Dark Mode you'll need to keep your screen brightness / backlight at a higher setting than if you're using light mode at night. This is deliberate, not a bug. If you are looking for something with a black background and white foreground what you're looking for is called "high contrast" or "inverse color" mode, not dark mode. This plugin _does not_ do high contrast / inverse color mode.

Dark Mode is unlikely to be included in Joomla itself ‚Äî even though [I did put the (very hard) work into it](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/39366). Maybe when Joomla merges Bootstrap 5.3 or later and maybe if someone comes to redo the hard work I did then maybe, just maybe, you might have Dark Mode in Joomla itself. Spontaneous porcine flight sounds more plausible than Joomla implementing Dark Mode the right way ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Support and contributions

I do not offer any kind of support. Using freely distributed software does not entitle you to free support or labor from its developers. There are no guarantees that your request will be implemented or ever responded to in a certain timeframe or at all.

Please note that the scope of this project is strictly the core Joomla templates Atum and Cassiopeia as delivered with Joomla itself and the core Joomla extensions. Modified or third party templates are explicitly outside the scope of this project. You can use this project's SCSS files as a starting point if you want but you're on your own. Third party extensions are explicitly outside the scope of this project as well. How your browser and OS implements dark mode is also out of scope, _especially_ if you are on Linux, older Windows versions or macOS versions older than Catalina.

Do note that some third party plugins may extend or override core features. For example: WYSIWYG editors, plugins which add fields to the Users page, or plugins which override the Media Manager and the media selection fields. These are considered third party extensions and are out of scope. 

If you have an in-scope issue please do file a GitHub issue where you give concise and precise reproduction instructions _on a brand new Joomla site with only DarkMagic installed and enabled_ and a clear description of your issue. Screenshots in PNG or JPG format attached to your GitHub issue are welcome. Screencasts (videos; inline or on third party sites like YouTube), animated GIFs, PDFs, Word documents etc are not acceptable and won't be opened unless you are explicitly asked to provide them.

If you want to contribute code, as long as it's not about supporting third party extensions, feel free to make a PR. If your PR is about adding support for additional CSS files so you could more easily support third party extensions, though, it will be considered and might even be accepted.

Please only use GitHub issues to contact me about this project. The one and only exception for that is security issues.

Finally, please be kind and understanding when contacting me. I am doing this on my very limited spare time. Thank you for keeping the conversation reasonable and civil!

## Building the package

### Quick'n'dirty build

In the simplest form you can ZIP the `plugins/system/darkmagic` folder's contents and install it on your site.

### Full build process

If you want to go through the build process I use you will need to have the following tools:

* A command line environment. Using Bash under Linux / Mac OS X works best.
* A PHP CLI binary in your path
* The sass (Sass / SCSS compiler) executable in your path
* The Composer executable in your path
* Phing installed account-wide on your machine and its executable in your path
* Command line Git executables in your path

You will also need the following path structure inside a folder on your system

* **darkmagic** This repository
* **buildfiles** [Akeeba Build Tools](https://github.com/akeeba/buildfiles)

You will need to use the exact folder names specified here.

Go into the `build` directory of this repository.

Create a dev release installation package with

		phing git
		
The installable ZIP file is stored in the `release` directory which will be created inside the repository's root.
