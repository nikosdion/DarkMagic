# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `master` and `development` branches are supported with security updates. The `master` branch represents the last published version, whereas the `development` branch represents the upcoming version.

I only support the latest published, stable Joomla version in the 3.x version range. I do not support Joomla alphas, betas or release candidates (testing releases). If a security issue only occurs with a testing release I will consider it but I cannot promise a rapid resolution.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a GitHub issue about security issues. GitHub issues are public.
Filing an issue about a security issue puts all users, you included, in immediate danger.

Please use my business [contact page](https://www.akeebabackup.com/contact-us.html) to send me a
private notification about the security issue. I strongly recommend using GPG to encrypt
your email. You can find my public GPG key at https://keybase.io/nikosdion

Please include instructions to reproduce the security issue. Better yet, please include Proof
Of Concept code if applicable.

## Expected timeframe

I aim to reply within a business week (5 working days excluding bank holidays). I request a period of 60 to 90 calendar days since I receive adequate information to reproduce the issue before public disclosure so I have time to address the security issue, publish a new version and make sure everyone is updated.
